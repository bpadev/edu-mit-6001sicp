; 4.3 Variations on a Scheme--Nondeterministic Computing
; Nondeterministic computing, like stream processing, is useful for "generate and test" applications.
; The key idea here is that expressions in a nondeterministic language can have more than one possible value.
; The nondeterministic program evaluator will free the programmer from the details of how choices are made.


; 4.3.1 Amb and Search


; 4.3.2 Examples of Nondeterministic Programs
; The advantage of nondeterministic programming is that we can surpress the details of how search is carried out, thereby expressing our programs at a higher level of abstraction.
