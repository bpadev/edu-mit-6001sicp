; 4.3 Variations on a Scheme--Nondeterministic Computing
; Nondeterministic computing, like stream processing, is useful for "generate and test" applications.
; The key idea here is that expressions in a nondeterministic language can have more than one possible value.
; The nondeterministic program evaluator will free the programmer from the details of how choices are made.
