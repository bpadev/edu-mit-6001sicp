; 2.2 Hierarchical Data and the Closure Property
; box-and-pointer representation
; closure meaning elements closed under an operation.


; 2.2.1 Representing Sequences
; - an ordered collection of data objects.
; It is better to have 100 functions operate on one data structure than to have 10 functions operate on 10 data structures.


; 2.2.2 Hierarchical Structures
; The representation of sequences in terms of lists generalizes naturally to represent sequences whose elements may themselves be sequences. 
; Another way to think of sequences whose elements are sequences is as trees.


; 2.2.3 Sequences as Conventional Interfaces 
; (do the map, filter, accumlator exercises)


; 2.2.4 Levels of language for robust design
; Stratified design, the notion that a complex system should be structured as a sequence of levels that are described using a sequence of languages.
; For example, in computer enginering, resistors and transistors are combined (and described using a language of analog circuits) to produce parts such as and-gates and or-gates, which form the primitives of a language for digital-circuit design.
