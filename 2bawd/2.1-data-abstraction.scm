; 2.1 Introduction to Data Abstraction
; Data abstraction is a methodology that enables us to isolate how a compound data object is used from the details of how it is constructed from more primitive data objects.
; Pairs allow us to construct a compound data object, we can access this object using car, cdr.


; 2.1.2 Abstraction Barriers
; In general, the underlying idea of data abstraction is to identify for each type of data object a basic set of operations in terms of which all manipulations of data objects of that type will be expressed, and then to use only those operations in manipulating the data.
; In effect, procedures at each level are the interfaces that define the abstraction barriers and connect the different levels.
