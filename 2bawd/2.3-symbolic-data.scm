; 2.3.3 Example: Representing Sets
; Focuses on most efficient ways to represent the data to improve space and time complexity. 
; The claim that searching a tree can be performed in a logarithmic number of steps rests on the assumption that the tree is "balanced", that the left and the right subtree of every tree have approximately the same number of elements, so that each subtree contains about half the elements of its parent.
